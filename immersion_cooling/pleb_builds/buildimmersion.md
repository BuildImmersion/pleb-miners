# BuildImmersion's (planned) single asic build

A single loop immersion system for S19s or M30s (or equivalent asics) with a focus on build quality (reliability), temperature and protection control (able to run unsupervised "forever"), negligible noise (fan will never need to run on max), flexible placement (inside or outside, heat exchanger placed by tank or externally).

* [DCX ThermaSafe R dielectric fluid](https://cryptocooling.eu/#fluid), two containers: $482 ($241 per container, $9.64 per litre)
* Tank will be custom made. Drawings can be found [here](https://keybase.pub/evenutstrand/Tank%20Drawings/). Estimated cost: ~$700
* Circulator pump to be determinded (TBD), but will start out with a used [Grundfos Alpha2 25-80 180 (~$250, 50W)](https://product-selection.grundfos.com/products/alpha/alpha2/alpha2-25-80-180-98649757?tab=variant-curves), read off flow and power parameters from its display, and calculate needed pump size from there. Estimate that a variant of [Grundfos Magna3](https://product-selection.grundfos.com/products/magna/magna3?tab=models) is needed: ~$600, 100-200W
* [16x16" heat exchanger](https://www.outdoorfurnacesupply.com/16x16-water-to-air-heat-exchanger-hot-water-coil-outdoor-wood-furnace-hwc-16x16.html): $149
* Custom made fan shroud for above heat exchanger. Drawings can be found [here](https://keybase.pub/evenutstrand/Fan%20Shroud%20Drawings/). Estimated cost: ~$250
* [350mm axial fan](https://ventilatorry.ru/downloads/ebmpapst/datasheet/s3g350-ag03-52-en-datasheet-ebmpapst.pdf). Purchased directly from ebm-papst: ~$350, <85W
* [PID speed controller for fan](https://www.alliedelec.com/product/red-lion-controls/pxu40030/71103615/): ~$140
* Other electrical and control components: ~$700
* Miscellaneous: ~$500

Total: ~$3871 + shipping etc.

Power consumption (estimated): 150W
