# The Pleb Tank

Bare-bones, cheapest possible build for the plebs. Single loop design to keep costs low. Modest cooling goals: handle an S9 or two and ideally go up to a 3kW S19 or 3.6kW Whatsminer.

Inspired by [Coin Heated's experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6ht1t5oWOo)

This is just a proposal so far; actual building and testing to come.

* BitCool cooling oil: $180 for 2L (5.28gal) + $28 shipping

Unused volume in the fish tank will have to be filled with some closed item (e.g. glass jars) to fill up space so that less cooling oil is needed.

Total: $433

Power consumption: 240W
