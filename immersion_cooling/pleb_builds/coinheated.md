# CoinHeated's double loop pool heating system

https://youtu.be/bF6dDlb3j9g

Hot oil flows over the divider to the submerged plate heat exchanger. A submersible utility pump picks up the hot oil and pumps it through the plate heat exchanger and out back into the immersion tank. A separate water loop runs through the plate heat exchanger and is pumped out to the pool and/or a radiator system for cooling.
